Recently I took on an incredible challenge from Codecrafters: building an HTTP server in Java completely from scratch!

At first glance, the task seemed simple, but the learning journey was anything but â€” from understanding the fundamentals of the web, handling TCP connections, parsing requests and headers, to implementing dynamic routes, gzip compression, and much more.

Beyond the technical depth, it was a fantastic opportunity to practice clean code, proper architecture, testing, and debugging. Seeing the server handle multiple clients in parallel and pass all the test cases was incredibly rewarding!

I highly recommend this experience to anyone looking to go beyond the basics, get a behind-the-scenes look at how the web really works, and get their hands dirty in the best possible way.

If you want to exchange ideas about the challenge or Java in general, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜‰
